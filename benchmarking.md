# running benchmarking


query types for hash and FM:
- what files does it occur in
- what read does it occur
- 

hash table

step 1: feed files in using glob
step 2: make instance of each data strucutre and time pre-processing steps
step 3: test on varying number of file sizes, k-mer doesn't have to be consistent and try on k-mer that doesn't exists. Call find sequence function and total number of occurrences function

FM-index:
step 1: build FM index
step 

GK Array:
step 1 list of files and size of k-mer just to build gk array
step 2: get_reads function that return mapping of files to read number


file size:

100 mb:
98_

1mb:
phix_reads


~100kb
1000 genomies
