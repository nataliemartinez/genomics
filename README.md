### Overview:
Indexing large collections of reads can be incredibly costly in terms of time and space. Traditional methods often surrender efficiency in one of these two areas for that in the other [2]. In our project, we plan to combine aspects of existing indexing data structures and algorithms to balance the tradeoff between time and space efficiency.
